# mpesa_sdk_dart

Dart package for M-Pesa API (Mozambique)

Ready Methods/APIs

- [x] C2B
- [x] B2B
- [x] B2C
- [x] TRANSACTION STATUS
- [ ] ACCOUNT BALANCE
- [x] REVERSAL

## Requisites
We highly recommend reading Mpesa API [docs](https://developer.mpesa.vm.co.mz/) first!

You Will need a few things from there before development.

1. Api Key
2. Public Key

- Login or Register as a M-Pesa developer [here](https://developer.mpesa.vm.co.mz/accounts/login/?next=/accounts/signup/) if you haven't.
- You will be issued with an API Key and a Public Key. You will use these to generate your access token.

## Getting Started

Add dependency in pubspec.yaml

```yaml
dependencies:
  mpesa_sdk_dart: [ADD_LATEST_VERSION_HERE]
```

Import in your Flutter app or plain dart app.
```dart
import 'package:mpesa_sdk_dart/mpesa_sdk_dart.dart';
```

### Generate a token

```dart
String token = MpesaConfig.getBearerToken(
    'API_KEY_HERE',
    'PUBLIC_KEY_HERE',
  );
```

### C2B Api Call

#### Initialize your payload

```dart
PaymentRequest payload = PaymentRequest(
    inputTransactionReference: 'inputTransactionReference',
    inputCustomerMsisdn: '25884xxxxxxx',
    inputAmount: inputAmount,
    inputThirdPartyReference: 'inputThirdPartyReference',
    inputServiceProviderCode: 'inputServiceProviderCode',
  );
```

#### Perform the api call

```dart
MpesaTransaction.c2b(token, payload);
```

### Handle response

All you need is assigning your call to a property of type Response (From [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package). Note that this is an async function

```dart
Response response = await MpesaTransaction.c2b(token, payload);
print(response.body);
```

### B2C Api Call

#### Initialize your payload

```dart
PaymentRequest payload = PaymentRequest(
    inputTransactionReference: 'inputTransactionReference',
    inputCustomerMsisdn: '25884xxxxxxx',
    inputAmount: inputAmount,
    inputThirdPartyReference: 'inputThirdPartyReference',
    inputServiceProviderCode: 'inputServiceProviderCode',
  );
```

#### Perform the api call

```dart
MpesaTransaction.b2c(token, payload);
```

### Handle response

All you need is assigning your call to a property of type Response (From [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package). Note that this is an async function

```

### REVERSAL Api Call

        inputSecurityCredential: "Mpesa2019",
        inputServiceProviderCode: "171717",
        inputReversalAmount: montant,
        inputThirdPartyReference: "11114");
```

#### Perform the api call

```dart
MpesaTransaction.reversal(token, payload);
```

    print(response.body);
```

```dart
TransferRequest payload = TransferRequest(
        inputTransactionReference: 'T12344C',
        inputPrimaryPartyCode: '171717',
        inputAmount: inputAmount,
        inputThirdPartyReference: '11114',
        inputReceiverPartyCode: "979797");
```
